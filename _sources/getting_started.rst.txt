Getting Started
===============

A series of iPython notebook files have been created to showcase the
functionality of `osmg`. They reside in the `examples
<https://github.com/ioannis-vm/OpenSees_Model_Generator/tree/main/examples>`_
directory of the `osmg` repository.

An auto-generated API reference, based on
docstring contents, is also available.
