.. py:class:: ComponentAssembly

   A component assembly represents some part of a structure and holds
   various lower-level elements such as nodes and beamcolumn
   elements.
   .. attribute:: uid

      Unique identifyer of the component assembly

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: parent_collection

      The collection of
      elements to which the component assembly belongs.

      :type: ComponentCollection

   .. attribute:: component_purpose

      The functionality of the component assembly

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: external_nodes

      the external nodes to which the
      component assembly is connected.
      these nodes should exist as part of a level.

      :type: NodeCollection

   .. attribute:: internal_nodes

      internal nodes that are
      required for the connectivity of the elements of the component
      assembly.
      these nodes only exist as part of the component assembly.

      :type: NodeCollection

   .. attribute:: elements

      Collection containing the elements that are part of the
      component assembly.

      :type: CollectionWithConnectivity

   .. py:attribute:: uid
      :annotation: :int

   .. py:method:: __post_init__()


   .. py:method:: __srepr__()

      Short version of repr


   .. py:method:: __repr__()

      Return repr(self).


   .. py:method:: dict_of_elements()

      Returns a dictionary of all element objects in the model.
      The keys are the uids of the objects.


   .. py:method:: list_of_elements()

      Returns a list of all element objects in the model.


   .. py:method:: element_connectivity()

      Returns the connectivity of all elements. Elements are
      connected to external nodes. Each component assembly can be
      represented by a tuple of node uids of its connected nodes in
      ascending order. This method returns a dictionary having these
      tuples as keys, and the associated components as values.
