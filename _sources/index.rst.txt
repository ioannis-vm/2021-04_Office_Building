Welcome to the documentation for `osmg`!
=================================

`osmg` is a Python package that provides useful functions and classes
for the definition and analysis of 3D OpenSees models. `osmg` attempts
to simplify the process of creating large models of complex
geometry. It only supports a subset of the functionality of OpenSees,
but can be easily extended to add more functionality when needed.

To get started with `osmg`, you can install it via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install osmg
